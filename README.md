This is a group project for CSC 466 Knowledge Discovery from Data. We are scraping Cal Poly pages that show class offerings and course catalogs for the CSSE and STAT departments to implement a bot able to answer questions about teachers, courses and sections. 

### Code Structure

* **data-sustainer** : Directory responsible for scraping all data and populating our DB.
* **bot** : Directory responsible for the implementation of our bot.
* **testing** : see 'how_to_test.txt' for testing instructions
